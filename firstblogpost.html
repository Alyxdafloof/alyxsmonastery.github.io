	<p>
		The review will mostly be about the general layout of the book,
		<br>
		the selection of writings,
		<br>
		and overall how much DEPTH I feel the book contains.
		<br>
		<br>
		I will also write reflections around individual writings
		in the treasury that stand out to me.

	<h1>When will the review come out?</h1>

	<p>
		The reflection on the diffrent writings will come out as I read and understand <br>
		but the final review there is no real way to know when that will come out.
